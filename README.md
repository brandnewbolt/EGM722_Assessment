The project repository containing source code and its associated files along with raw datasets used for the study is located at this link: 
https://github.com/brandnewbolt/EGM722_Assessment 

This repository contains a .py (Pycharm) and .ipynb (jupyter notebook) source code file with the same content, and associated LICENSE, README.md, environment.yml and .gitignore files along with the raw datasets.

If online viewing is adequate, then simply follow step [1] below and click the repository link to view and click on relevant files in the repository.  
If it is required to pull files to local PC, it is necessary to first set up several elements to view the code and associated files (plus datasets).

[1] Initially, create a Git online account here https://github.com/ (GitHub, 2022). 
[2] Secondly, install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads.  Select the correct operating platform, initiate the installer and follow the steps below. 
[2.1] Select the installation location (default preferred).
[2.2] Select default on the second window. 
[2.3] Select a preferred text editor (e.g., notepad++).
[2.4] Select ‘override the default branch name for new repositories and type main.  This will align with future changes to the repository name.
[2.5] Select ‘Git from command line and also from 3rd-party software’ to allow Git to be used from its’ own command line tool and operate across multiple 3rd party platforms such as the Pycharm integrated development environment (IDE).
[2.6] Select the default ‘Checkout windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings’ to allow for conversion of line format in code.
[2.7] Select ‘Use MinTTY (the default terminal of MSSYS2)’ to allow Git to install Git Bash.
[2.8] Select the default ‘fast forward or merge’ to allow ‘standard pull behaviour’.  Several steps after this require default options to be selected until the final install screen is reached, install with defaults.  
[3] Thirdly, install Github Desktop on PC. This is available here https://desktop.github.com/ (GitHub, 2022).  Select defaults from the installer and once installed, open Github desktop, select file/ options/ accounts to log in to 
Github account created in step [1]. This will sync the Git suite and allow for files to be transferred from GitHub desktop to the cloud (and vice versa). 
[4] Open Git online (created in step [1]) and ‘fork’ the repository linked above.  To do this, click fork (upper right) to copy all materials from here over to your online account. 
[5] Return to Github desktop, and ‘clone’ the ‘forked’ repository from the browser to the GitHub desktop.  To do this, select file/clone repository and select the correct repository from the list or your repositories and clone to 
preferred location. 

Once these steps have been taken, the repository can be accessed via PC at the folder selected during the cloning stage [5], however this will likely be via notepad/ notepad++ depending on installed text editor and source code can be 
difficult to read.  It is advised to have Pycharm (‘Community’ is open source) installed on PC to view the code. There are numerous ways to install Pycharm advised from the developer 
https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html#toolbox (JetBrains, 2022).  A ‘standalone’ option is given to install the GUI as single software application, as opposed to a package.  Once this is installed, open using 
PC start menu, and a source code file from the windows folder location to view it as read only.
